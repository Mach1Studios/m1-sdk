### Summary ###

Examples and scripts of the logic used to load *n* number of channels that equally sum together for a consistent 100% summed output volume. Load mono/stereo or multichannel audio streams, then our algorithms virtualize a simplified Vector Based Panning format with source points in degrees around the listener (both pitch and yaw). Use the orientation data to properly change gain between *n* channels and correctly assemble the full stereo image of that orientation without additional processing/DSP/filtering/delay. Mach1's VVBP (Virtual Vector Based Panning) formats are the only fully transparent spatial audio format, because of this the effectiveness of directionality is completely determined by the content creator/audio engineer.
