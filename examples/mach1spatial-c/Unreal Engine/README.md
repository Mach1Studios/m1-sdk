## Mach1 Unreal Engine Integration Examples

### INSTALLATION
#### Installing Mach1 Decode Plugin (Mach1 Spatial VVBP Decoding) 
 - It is recommended to install the source code plugin as supplied. The binary staged plugins are difficult to install to the engine from version to version so the source code is supplied for use with the UAT.
 - Installation README supplied with plugin directory.  
#### Set Project setting to play sound with volume = 0 (Virtualize Silent Sounds)
