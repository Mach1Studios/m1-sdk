### Mach1 Android Examples

_These are just basic examples of integration and use of the Mach1 Spatial APIs._

### Current Demos:
 - m1-example: Encoding example with every API integrated and a simple GUI example included (packaged via jitpack)
 - m1-decode-example: Decoding example with variable device conditions and update rates (packaged as a standalone example), designed for low latency integration and tests, requires c++ understanding and illustrates a different integration.
