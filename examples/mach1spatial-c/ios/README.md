## Setup
Ideally you will want to decide on your preffered way to stream audio to the Mach1Decode lib depending on whether you application supports
multichannel audio files or not. 

- Check that the parent directory of `libMach1DecodeCAPI.a` to your Library Search Paths to import Mach1Decode lib.
Example: `"$(SRCROOT)/../../../../binaries/ios/lib/"`
