1. License Grant; Limitations.

a. Subject to the terms and conditions of this MACH1 SDK Royalty Free Agreement, MACH1 hereby grants to DEVELOPER a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-royalty bearing (limited solely to the “Royalty Free Uses” as defined herein) worldwide license to use, reproduce, display and distribute the MACH1 SDK in its current version only for the sole purpose of integration, use by and distribution with DEVELOPER’s application (collectively referred to as a “Developer Application”), it being understood that such distribution shall not include distribution of the MACH1 SDK in Source Code (“Source Code” meaning the source code for the MACH1 SDK, and any and all information and materials concerning such source code disclosed by the MACH1 SDK) form, or distributed as an individual or independent application, file or files separate and apart from the Developer Application.

b. The license granted under Section 1(a) of this MACH1 SDK Royalty Free Agreement shall be non-royalty bearing only up to and including a total of One Hundred Thousand (100,000) end user distributions (e.g., downloads or electronically or otherwise distributed copies, each a “Distribution”) (collectively, the “Royalty Free Uses”) of the Developer Application. For each end user distribution in excess of the Royalty Free Uses, DEVELOPER shall pay a royalty under a MACH1 SDK Paid License Agreement, as explained in Section 7(b). No rights are granted beyond the Royalty Free Uses, and any Distribution of the Developer Application incorporating the MACH1 SDK beyond the Royalty Free Uses shall be royalty bearing and require separate licensing from MACH1.

Failure to include such EULA shall be considered a material breach of this MACH1 SDK Royalty Free Agreement. For the sake of clarity, MACH1’s EULA will apply only to third party end users of the Developer Application Distributed with the MACH1 SDK, while DEVELOPER’s obligations as to the MACH1 SDK are controlled by this MACH1 SDK Royalty Free Agreement.

3. Developer Covenants; Restrictions. By accepting the terms and conditions of this MACH1 SDK Royalty Free Agreement, DEVELOPER hereby agrees:

c. Not to permit, authorize, license or sublicense any third party to access, view, copy or use the Source Code or derivatives thereof, other than with respect to examples provided with the MACH1 SDK;

g. Not to facilitate the use of the MACH1 SDK in any manner which would constitute a breach of the terms and conditions of this MACH1 SDK Royalty Free Agreement by DEVELOPER;
h. Not to place or distribute the MACH1 SDK on any website or ftp server without also including a copy of this MACH1 SDK Royalty Free Agreement, or the MACH1 EULA, as the case may be; and

At the request of MACH1, all unlicensed uses and distributions shall cease, and this MACH1 SDK Royalty Free Agreement shall be considered to be terminated.
c. Audit Rights. Should DEVELOPER fail to obtain a royalty-bearing, paid extended use license after distributing the MACH1 SDK as part of a Developer Application beyond the Royalty Free Uses or should MACH1 have a reasonable basis to believe that the end user Distribution exceeds or exceeded the 100,000 Royalty Free Uses, MACH1 shall have the right, upon reasonable prior notice, to audit/inspect any premises, computer(s), and networks on or in which the MACH1 SDK is installed or used to monitor compliance with the terms of this MACH1 SDK Royalty Free Agreement, including but not limited to confirming the number of computers on which the MACH1 SDK is used and whether any unauthorized copies have been made.

MACH1 SHALL NOT IN ANY CASE BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, DATA, OR PROGRAMS, EVEN IF MACH1 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

You shall indemnify and hold harmless MACH1 from and against all losses, claims, damages or other causes of any nature or kind whatsoever (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising directly or indirectly out of third party claims concerning (i) a breach of any of your obligations, covenants, representations or warranties contained herein; (ii) any Developer Application or other product developed by you using the MACH1 SDK; (iii) any combination of the MACH1 SDK, or any component of it, with any product developed by you using the MACH1 SDK or with any other product, equipment, device, software, system or data not supplied by MACH1, and (iv) the negligence or intentional misconduct of DEVELOPER or DEVELOPER’s officers, employees, agents or contractors.
