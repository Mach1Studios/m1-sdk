9.	CUSTOMIZED FEATURES AND FEES / USE BEYOND ROYALTY FREE USES: 
	i.	We may opt to make available certain customized features of the SDK in exchange for the payment of certain fees, in which case, DEVELOPER and MACH1 may enter into another agreement, which shall supersede this Agreement, as agreed to by the parties. 
	ii.	Licenses beyond 100,000 Distributions: You agree to contact MACH1 at licensing@mach1.tech to obtain a paid license in one of the scenarios described under Section 3 (ix) and (xi).  If you fail to do so and continue to distribute an Application utilizing MACH1 SPATIAL APIs beyond the royalty free uses described under this Agreement, you shall immediately contact MACH1 and pay to MACH1 a royalty per each Distribution (as defined below) in an amount as solely determined by MACH1. A Distribution refers to either an embedded, pre-bundled, pre-installed platform application or software application that is downloaded, delivered, or served to a user or device by any means of distribution including directly from you or through any platform, including cloud based platforms. For the purpose of determining the number of installs or distributions of any Application, the aggregate number of installs across target operating systems, devices or platforms shall be used. For example; if "AudioX App" has 50,000 app installs on iOS and 100,000 app installs on Android, then AudioX App shall have 150,000 app installs for purposes of this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, any subscription or rental shall be considered a Distribution. No rights are granted beyond the ROYALTY FREE USES, and any Distribution of the DEVELOPER APPLICATION incorporating the MACH1 SPATIAL SDK beyond the ROYALTY FREE USES shall be royalty bearing and require separate licensing from MACH1. 
	iii.	Open source: You agree to contact MACH1 via email at licensing@mach1.tech if your Application includes software that integrates, applies, or utilizes in an open source environment to obtain a paid license of the SDK – which you agree and understand is required for such a scenario. 
	iv.	Audit Rights: Should you fail to obtain a royalty-bearing, paid extended use license after distribution the SDK as part of an Application beyond the ROYALTY FREE USES or should MACH1 have a reasonable basis to believe that the end user Distribution exceeds or exceeded the 100,000 licenses, MACH1 shall have the right, upon reasonable notice, to audit/inspect any premises, computer(s), and networks on or in which the SDK is installed or used to monitor compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to confirming the number of Distributions of the Application. If an audit reveals any unauthorized use, in addition to all other remedies available to Mach1, you shall be responsible to Mach1 for all reasonable expenses related to the audit. 

10.	PRIVACY POLICY: You shall have a privacy policy posted on your website in accordance with all applicable data and privacy laws and include relevant sections from our Privacy Policy, which can be found at www. mach1.tech/privacy-policy.
